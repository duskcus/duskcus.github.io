<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>What is Laravel?</h3>
<p>Laravel is a great framework for quickly building web apps, with a large ecosystem. While it's slightly slower than some frameworks, the difference is often negligible. It's ideal for most projects unless when N2 notation becomes critical, which in 99% of cases it won't.</p>
