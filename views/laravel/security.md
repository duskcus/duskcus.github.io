<h3>Laravel Security Packages:</h3>
<p>Gate = Static admin and roles.</p>
<p>Laravel Fortify = Breeze without the garbage files, pretty good.</p>
<p>Laravel Sanctum = Lightweight API tokens for singlepage applications.</p>
<p>Laravel Passport = Oauth and 3rd party integrations.</p>
<p>Laravel TwoFactor = Easy and safe implemntation.</p>
<p>Laravel Passkey = Modern solution, but unforgiving if you're a bad programmer.</p>
<p>Breeze = Not as flexibel, and it is quite easy to setup normal authorisation. It's okay tho.</p>
<p>Jetstream = Bloated with ratchet components, and just as inflexible.</p>
