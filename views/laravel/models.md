<h2>1.3 MODELS</h2>
<p>Models are a bit like blueprints, they are often specifically made to communicate between a controller and a view or contain the logic for interacting with a database. Laravel expects it to be a capilised singular noun so what you would type to make one would be:</p>

<div class="codesnippet-wrapper">
  <div class="line-numbers">
</div>
<pre class="codesnippet"><code>php artisan make:model Product</code></pre></div>
