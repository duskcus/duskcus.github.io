<h3>Set-up</h3>
<p>Laravel is a great framework for quickly building web apps, with a large ecosystem. While it's slightly slower than some frameworks, the difference is often negligible. It's ideal for most projects unless when N2 notation becomes critical, which in 99% of cases it won't.</p>

<h3>Step 1. Create a Laravel project:</h3>
<p>“projectname” can be changed to desired name.</p>
<div class="codesnippet-wrapper">
  <div class="line-numbers">
</div>
<pre class="codesnippet">
<code>laravel new <span style="color: red;">projectname</span></code></pre></div>
